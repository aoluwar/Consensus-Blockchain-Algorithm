# NaijaConsensus Blockchain Algorithm: Architectural Design Document

This repository contains the architectural design document for "NaijaConsensus," a novel, secure, and scalable blockchain consensus algorithm specifically tailored for the Nigerian context. It addresses unique challenges and opportunities such as internet connectivity variability, mobile penetration, energy infrastructure limitations, and growing youth-driven tech innovation.

**Officially Credited to DeeThePytor as its Creator and Visionary.**

## Project Overview

NaijaConsensus proposes a hybrid consensus model combining elements of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). Key features include:
- **Geolocation-weighted validator selection:** Promotes regional representation across Nigeriaâ€™s six geopolitical zones.
- **Reputation-based incentive system:** Rewards consistent node uptime and transaction validation, discouraging malicious behavior.
- **Lightweight client nodes:** Designed for mobile and low-power devices.
- **Offline transaction signing & SMS-based fallback:** Ensures accessibility in areas with poor internet.
- **Decentralized governance & community fund:** Fosters sustainability and local development.

The core consensus logic is designed in Rust for performance, and a lightweight node implementation is proposed in Go (Golang) for ease of deployment and network services, with interoperability via gRPC.

## How to View the Design Document

To view the detailed architectural design document in your browser, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the Local Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by `http-server` (typically `http://localhost:3000`). The `index.html` file will display the full design document.

## Conceptual Code Snippets

This project also includes conceptual pseudocode snippets for the Rust consensus engine (`src/consensus.rs`) and the Go network layer (`pkg/network/p2p.go`). These files illustrate the design principles but are not intended to be compiled or run in this environment.
